# Quiz-App
Quiz Application made with HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Description

-The main goal for this project was to create a quiz application that would track your high score in local storage.

-Started the project hard coding in the HTML and realized that was the wrong way to go so switched it to dynamic in js. 

-HTML/CSS are completed and provide a great UI, the JS part is not completed yet but will be soon.
 
-An array of question is loaded and ready to display at the push of a button. 

-A timer is on the top of the screen when the page starts but the decresed button needs to be applied to clicking on an answer.
